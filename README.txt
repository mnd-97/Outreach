1. Please first extract this folder to a directory of your choice.
2. Open outreach.html, this is the main webpage. External links to the App store and Google Play store are safe to use.


In the folder are numerous elements required for the website to function properly, so please ensure nothing is deleted or moved.
The elements include, but are not limited to:
	- The core coding of the site itself
	- CSS files (stylising of the webpage e.g. boxes, lines, pictures)
	- Font files
	- Javascript files for animations


There is also the summary within the .zip file.

I have also added links to a VR app. If I was to do this exhibition in person, I would set up my iPad with headphones and allow users to experience the app for themselves.

Ideally, if people wanted to experience A Walk Through Dementia on their own devices, I would be happy to.


Instructions for VR app usage
1. Download onto your device, Android or iOS.
2. Open the app; this should work on most modern Android and Apple phones.


This will only work for smartphones with a gyroscope built in (motion sensor).
