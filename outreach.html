								<p>Happiness, movement, memories, sight, taste, the understanding of knowing where you are, consciousness, breathing; all of these sensations, feelings, thoughts are processed by and amalgamate into one structure: the brain, arguably the most vital organ in the human body. An extremely intricate and complex organ, it is involved in all of the above and countless other functions that occur every millisecond that we do not even know are occurring; they are simply second nature to us. However, due to its Daedalian nature, this also makes it just as hard to be able to unravel its mysteries and not only understand why the way things are the way they are, but also how a normal process or structure within the brain can go awry on a microscopic and cellular level, leading to a plethora of diseases and illnesses associated with the brain.</p>
								<p>One of these diseases that can affect the brain is Alzheimer’s disease, by interrupting normal function and leading to progressive decline and physical shrinkage of the brain.. To date, a cure still has not been found, and its prevalence continues to increase. My research aims to increase our understanding of Alzheimer’s, and whether certain medications and lab-synthesised compounds can help treat brains with Alzheimer’s disease-associated features, using an animal model.</p>

						<!-- What is Alzheimer's? -->
							<article id="what">
								<h2 class="major">What is Alzheimer's disease?</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/br.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The central nervous system is a collective term for the brain and the spinal cord: central bases of the body, where stimuli (an event that produces a response e.g. touching a hot pan) from the outside world are picked up, processed, and an appropriate response elicited; all of this is done through nerves. Some of these stimuli are even within our own bodies, and our brains and spinal cords respond accordingly to keep our bodies in optimal operating conditions. Cells are the microscopic building blocks of our body, in every organ. A major component of the central nervous system and nerves are neurons, which are nerve cells; these are the cells that pick up a stimulus and will pass it on to another neuron and another neuron and so forth, so our brains can formulate an appropriate response. Sometimes, as with all things, these building blocks can become injured and eventually begin to not function optimally and ultimately die. This can be due to a number of things or conditions. A specific group of conditions that can lead to these neurons becoming dysfunctional and dying are called neurodegenerative diseases: neuro pertaining to the brain, and degenerative relating to the degenerative nature of the condition: progressive deterioration of the cell in question until they ultimately die.</p>
								<p>Alzheimer’s disease is a type of neurodegenerative condition. These are conditions that, as mentioned before, get worse over time. They are long-term conditions, and lead to a multitude of symptoms and issues within the afflicted individual that makes daily activities much more difficult. It is also classed as a type of dementia and is the most common type of dementia. Dementia is not a condition, but a term that pertains to a collection of symptoms including memory, cognitive and social impairment. Dementia can be caused by a number of things besides Alzheimer’s e.g. reduced blood flow to the brain, leading to reduced brain function and a less optimised environment for the brain to work in.</p>
								<p>To briefly add, on a microscopic level in Alzheimer’s, individuals get build-up of toxic substances, and coupled with ageing in the brain leading to lower efficiency (discussed in the “Why” section), these toxic substances remain and damage neurons, leading to their dysfunction and death. The issue is that 2 of the main toxic substances associated with Alzheimer’s come from some error within normal mechanisms in the body i.e. our cells within our bodies use countless proteins to communicate or function on a microscopic level and these proteins can become damaged and not be the correct shape for their function (e.g. imagine a lock and key, and bending the key; you would not be able to open said lock). In the human body, 2 proteins that function normally become misshapen and deformed, and thus these proteins cannot act typically to keep neurons functioning at their optimal conditions, and are also perceived as threats by the cell so they are cleared. An increase in deformed proteins and thus less non-functioning proteins means neuronal functioning goes down, but also the inherent toxic nature of the deformed proteins damages and kills cells. The dead neurons shrink and their debris removed, and you will, in a CT scanner or MRI, see shrinkage of the brain (take a look at the background of this page; the left side of the brain is typical, and the right is Alzheimer’s: you can see the stark difference in how much less brain is present; you can even see shrinkage at the top of this section, with a normal brain, mild and severe Alzheimer's and how it changes the brain).</p>
								<p>Alzheimer’s leads to a reduced quality of life, and affects individuals far beyond the well-known symptom of memory loss: issues with vision, navigating areas and getting lost, not being able to judge distances or speeds well; to know what this may feel like, please navigate to the “Experience” tab, where you can find out more.</p>

						<!-- Why Alzheimer's? -->
							<article id="why">
								<h2 class="major">Why Alzheimer's?</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/why.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In 2020, dementia and Alzheimer’s was the second highest cause of death (11.5% of all deaths), behind only COVID-19 (12.1% of all deaths). Not only that, but it’s estimated that nearly 25% of those who died due to COVID-19 had a co-existing diagnosis of dementia. This represents a huge proportion of deaths within the UK, being higher than even heart attacks, strokes and lung cancer.</p>
								<p>As mentioned in the “What” section, Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease, leading to progressive deterioration of functioning brain cells and ultimately their death, leading to deficits in typical functioning of the body. This neurodegenerative behaviour is more likely in the elderly population. This is because our brain cells, our neurons, begin to exhibit changes and function naturally less well over time. To explain how this happens, I will briefly talk about some mechanisms that keeps our brain healthy, and use some analogies to help explain some concepts better. </p>
								<p>Our brain cells, specifically our neurons, have “security systems”, which will monitor and detect things that are inside brain cells that may be harmful, and will attempt to remove these harmful or toxic things. However, over time, these so-called systems that protect our neurons from toxins and other harmful things will become less efficient e.g. much like a car, over time, will begin to not function as it was brand new. This means that our neurons within our brains, as we age, become more prone to not picking up toxic substances that may be inside neurons and could potentially harm or kill the neurons.</p>
								<p>Our brain cells (neurons) are also maintained by a certain structure, with numerous elements to it. Much like a building stands strong initially, over time it will begin to crumble and cracks will appear, and it will lose its integrity. This is the same with neurons. As we age, their structural integrity lessens, and the things that keep our brain cells strong and stable begin to become weaker over time, and eventually they will not be able to function anymore.</p>
								<p>Both of these inefficiencies come with age, and lead to neuron and brain cell death, meaning you lose functional capacity of the brain progressively over time. This correlates with Alzheimer’s being primarily a disease of the elderly, since as you age, these inefficiencies in our neurons becoming less able to remove harmful proteins or substances and also becoming structurally weaker means they are more prone to being damaged and dying, leading to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer’s.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, our population is ageing fairly quickly. In fact, 16% of the current population in Europe is over 65 years of age and is predicted to reach 25% by 2030. It is said that 1 in 3 people born today will develop some sort of dementia (the most common group of neurodegenerative diseases) and 1 million people within the UK are expected to have dementia by 2025, a prevalence of over 1%. The issue is that most neurodegenerative diseases have no effective treatment, and none have any cure; current treatments are only able to provide symptomatic relief or to slow or halt progression of the condition. Furthermore, our understanding of Alzheimer's is still very fragmented; we know that it is a multi-faceted condition with numerous components that elicit its symptoms and signs, yet it is all still weaved into an intricate web that we must first untangle to get any idea of how to target areas for therapeutic benefit. Ergo, there is a dire need for advancements in treatments for neurodegenerative disease.</p>
								<p>All of this shows why it is vital to study Alzheimer’s. Like many other fatal conditions such as cancer, there is not a full understanding of how it arises but also unlike these other fatal diseases, there is a severe lack in treatment we can offer patients. With Alzheimer’s rising to the top as a cause of death, and with an ageing population with no cure, it will quickly become a huge burden to not only healthcare services but also to countless people in the future and will be a great distress for many people not only in the UK but globally.</p>

								<h2 class="major">My research into Alzheimer's</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/mt.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>As mentioned before (in the “What” section), there are 2 main toxic substances that build up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients; these spread throughout the brain and lead to brain cell death. Both of these proteins come from erroneous processing within the cell, which is more likely with age. One of these is called tau. Imagine a tunnel, where cars go through both ways; our neurons have a similar thing in their neurons, named axons.. This is essentially the highway of the brain cell, a neuron, where proteins and signals pass down to reach from one end to the other in a quick and orderly fashion in order to pass signals and proteins to where they need to go to, much like drivers need to get from A to B and a tunnel is part of their journey. This axon is kept stable by a tau protein. However, unbind tau or make it dysfunctional, and this axon will destabilise and break down. Now imagine a broken or caved in tunnel. This makes it non-functional, and drivers would not be able to get from A to B. The image above shows, on the left, a normal "neuron highway" or axon, and on the right, a damaged one. The red parts represent tau, and on the right you can see less and misshapen tau which leads to destabilisation and breakdown. This destabilisation of the axon leads to death of the neuron, as many of the things that go through the neuronal tunnel, the axon, help keep the cell alive. Note that tau in itself is essential for normal function, but deformation of it is what causes issues.</p>
								<p>As we know by now, Alzheimer’s is a progressive condition, and spreads over the brain in a specific fashion. Furthermore, we know that this tau protein is essential for keeping neurons alive but also stable and their highways stable. As tau is a protein, it will also inherently travel down this highway and into other cells, spreading throughout the brain. When tau becomes deformed, it is not only toxic to the cell and causes destabilisation of these neuron highways, but it also influences normal tau to become deformed as well. In addition, these misshapen tau are also more likely to clump together and "aggregate". Imagine a giant boulder in the tunnel or a highway; it would inevitably block all transport both ways. Again, this is what happens in a neuron when tau is damaged due to Alzheimer's-related changes; sometimes the misshapen tau simply occupies so much space and crows out essential function that the neuron dies. Putting these together, you can imagine that even one deformed tau protein will influence other normal essential forms to become deformed, these will then spread and influence more normal tau throughout the brain to become misshapen, and misshapen tau will clump together to form large tau structures that can kill the neuron.</p>
								<p>I will be looking into tau, and how it spreads, and whether neurons can be rescued after tau has spread, and at what point rescue is not possible. How I will be doing this is explored further in the “How” section. This will allow me to study a major aspect of Alzheimer’s disease, and hopefully shed some light on how it arises, its progressive nature and possibly a way to save neurons.</p>

						<!-- How -->
							<article id="how">
								<h2 class="major">How will I research this?</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/confocal.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Animal models have come a long way in teaching the human race about vital processes that go on in our bodies, not just the brain. One of these is a fruit fly species, which bears a simple brain and neurons (not as complex as the human system) but still similar to humans and a good model nonetheless. Its brain, much like humans, is comprised of numerous areas that are responsible for many things e.g. a centre for vision, smell, movement etc. This makes it an effective model to map disease to, in search for human cures.</p>
								<p>I will be utilising these fruit flies, and modelling tau spread in these flies using genetics. This allows for recreation of an aspect of Alzheimer’s disease that can be more ethically and easily studied; in this case, spread of misshapen tau. It also allows quick study as well; unlike in humans, it takes a few days to few weeks for Alzheimer's like changes to appear in a fly brain, yielding quicker results. Although it may seem pointless conducting the experiment in a fly, it is quicker, more ethical, relatively easy to study and the results can be extrapolated and applied in human context as well, owing to how the brain is structured in these flies. I will then image these flies and see how the misshapen tau has spread over time in the brain, giving an insight into how misshapen tau spreads and over what sort of time period. Then, I will run the experiment again but this time, partway through, I will add a medication which will reduce the ability of tau to become misshapen, and then will observe again under the microscope to see if these substances added affect tau spread in any way.</p>

						<!-- Impact -->
							<article id="impact">
								<h2 class="major">Impact of my study</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/impact.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Our current understanding of Alzheimer’s disease is a lot better than it was 20, 30 years ago. However, that does not mean that we now fully know the changes that occur in a patient with Alzheimer’s. Current understanding tells us that Alzheimer’s starts in one part of the brain and spreads gradually throughout the rest of the brain, eventually causing more and more symptoms and along the way, damaging an increasing number of neurons. It tends to start in an area of the brain called the hippocampus, which is responsible for the conversion and storage of short-term memory to long-term. This explains why one of the most common and most recognised symptom of Alzheimer’s disease is memory loss.</p>
								<p>The spread of Alzheimer’s is extremely important to understand, in order to teach us how we can begin to formulate effective therapies for Alzheimer’s. My study will provide great insight into how a vital normal protein (tau) that is required for normal brain cell function and structure and its misshapen form spreads to cause Alzheimer’s, and a possible understanding of mechanisms that link the process of tau becoming misshapen and the way in which it spreads and the degree of spread as well. It will also provide insight into whether brain cells can be rescued if affected by Alzheimer’s, and when the point of no return is.</p>

								<p>A unique VR app, developed by Alzheimer’s Research UK, allows you to experience what it is like to have Alzheimer’s disease, with 3 scenarios available in the app. It provides great insight into dementia and living with Alzheimer’s, and how this affects the individual besides memory impairment. Every person with dementia and Alzheimer’s will have different experiences; this VR app hopes to provide just a few of those.</p>
								<p>Please note that if you have an Android device, you can download this app and use the gyroscope in your phone as normal VR or use Google Cardboard.</p>
								<p>For Apple devices, Google Cardboard will not work, so VR experience will use the device gyroscope only.</p>
								<p>Please click one of the following links below for your preferred device, or simply search "A Walk Through Dementia" in your device's application store and it should pop up. Install it, and follow the instructions on the screen; moving the phone in space will also move your perspective of the scenario you are in e.g. what way you are facing.</p>
